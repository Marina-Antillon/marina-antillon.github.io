  Marina Antillon, PhD.

I am an analyst at the intersection of public health, data sciences, and decision analysis. I have worked extensively in simulation-based health economics of strategies to control and eliminate infectious diseases. 

My methodological interests lie in transmission and Markov models of disease, as well as decision-making under probabilistic and structural uncertainty. I have disease-area expertise in typhoid fever, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), as well as experience in tuberculosis, cholera, and sleep behaviours. I also have experience teaching small seminars in statistics and health economics.

I am open to work in public health (all disease areas), in particular in epidemiology and health economics and outcomes research (HEOR). If my methodological experience can be of use, I would also be interested in working on data analysis of social and environmental phenomena.
